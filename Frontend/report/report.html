            Brain surgeons need steady hands as well as cool heads. Now they’re getting a helping hand from researchers in Europe to fight a fatal type of brain cancer called glioblastoma.
            A Danish biotechnology company named FluoGuide led a research project that received EU funding to pinpoint glioblastoma better so surgeons can more easily remove it. FluoGuide developed a fluorescent chemical dye that’s injected into patients before surgery.
